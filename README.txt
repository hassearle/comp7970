RULES FOR GITHUB
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	* no commits to master

	* start out by makeing a branch, from there feel free to commit and push 
		it to github. This way other people can view and work on each others 
		code

	* if you finish a section of code (unless its something very small), 
		make a pull request on github and once everyone approves, we'll 
		commit to master
